# Data Science Project: Customer Segmentation - Overview 
* Created a template for segmentation analysis 
* Dataset contains information about bank customers (this is training dataset provided by tutor in csv file) 
* Dataset were cleaned, scaled and analysed 
* Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms were applied like K-Means, 'Elbow Method', Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
* Created and optomised autoencoder based on two artificial neural networks 


### Motivation
Marketing is a filar for growth and sustainability of any business. Knowlege about markets and customers is crucial for any strategic decisions, which can create a strong brand and increase sales.
