# Data Science Project: Customer Segmentation - Overview 
* Created a template for segmentation analysis 
* Dataset contains marketing information about bank customers (this is training dataset provided by tutor in csv file) 
* Dataset were cleaned, scaled and analysed
* Applied unsupervised machine learning algorithms: K-Means with help of ‘Elbow Method’ and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* Created and optimized autoencoder based on two artificial neural networks 


### Motivation
