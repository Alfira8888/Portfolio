# [Data Science Project: Customer Segmentation - Overview](https://github.com/Alfira8888/Customer_segmentation)
* Created a template for segmentation analysis 
* Dataset contains marketing information about bank customers (this is training dataset provided by tutor in csv file) 
* Dataset were cleaned, scaled and analysed
* Applied unsupervised machine learning algorithms: K-Means with help of ‘Elbow Method’ and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* Created and optimized autoencoder based on two artificial neural networks 
* Created report with results in form of PDF file 


### Motivation
Marketing is a pillar for growth and sustainability of any business. Knowledge about markets and customers is crucial for any strategic decisions, which can create a strong brand and increase sales. Segmentation is one of the most important application of unsupervised learning. Using clustering techniques, companies can identify groups of customers allowing them to understand customers behavior and for example, recognize a target of marketing campaign.
